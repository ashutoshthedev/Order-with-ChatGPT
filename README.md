Order your food with ChatGPT
I have just learnt way to make a food ordering bot using ChatGPT. You can use it to make your own bot for different purposes. You can also add more option in the menu and more function to the bot for smooth interaction. I will also try to add more things in this in future.  
You can use order.py for the bot and OrderSummary.py to get the order summary/bill of the customer. You can also add this bill in a database using MySQL.  

Modules that I have used:  
```os: Comes pre-installed with python```  
```openai: pip install openai```  
```dotenv: pip install python-dotenv```  
```panel: pip install panel```
